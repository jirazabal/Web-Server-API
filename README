-----------------------------------

This is the API for the web-based Moodle -> MongoDB application [TODO: Think of an actual name] created for the University of Delaware CISC Department.  The purpose of this application is to allow the import of questions into MongoDB after exporting them from Moodle, and to allow a user to add and edit data about each question, to aid in test creation for CISC 106 (General Computer Science for Engineers, an introductory programming class using Python).

-----------------------------------
Dependencies (note these are the versions the software was created with, not minimums):
-----------------------------------

mongodb 4.03
node 8.10.0
npm 3.5.2

the following npm packages:
express 4.16.4
targz 1.0.1

No known conflicts arise from installing the components in any particular order.

******************************
* IMPORTANT NOTE FOR MONGODB *
******************************
The version of mongodb in the Ubuntu repositories is outdated, and neither created nor  maintained by MongoDB.  Furthermore, it WILL cause conflicts with the official version.  Follow the instructions at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ to either add a repository and install the "mongodb-org" package or download the binaries.  You can also find and compile the source code from https://github.com/mongodb/mongo.
******************************

-----------------------------------
Instructions
-----------------------------------
Once all components are installed and mongod is running on the server, navigate to Web-Server-API/node-rest-api/ and run the server with "npm start".  The server will confirm a connection with Mongo and listen on port 3000 on all interfaces for http methods (GET, POST, etc. - see express).  The API expects a file with extension .mbz, a moodle export format that is simply a .tar.gz file with a large directory tree and various .xml files.  Each file is expected to contain a single question.

-----------------------------------
Known Issues
-----------------------------------

Conflict between ubuntu packages "mongodb" and "mongodb-org" (see note in Dependencies section).

MongoDB is supposed wo run with local user permissions, but version 4.03 will not run without access wo unknown shared libraries.  Installation using the MongoDB repository is suggested.
